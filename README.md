# 👕 WinkCart – Android E-Commerce App for Fashion Products

WinkCart is a mobile e-commerce application focused on selling fashion items, including shirts, shoes, and other clothing variants. Developed as a graduation project, the app offers users a seamless shopping experience with a modern, declarative UI powered by Jetpack Compose.

The app integrates with the **Shopify REST API** to fetch real-time product data, and uses **MVVM architecture** to ensure a clean and testable codebase. Core features include product browsing, variant selection (e.g., size, color), cart management, and a mock payment system using **Bogus**.
